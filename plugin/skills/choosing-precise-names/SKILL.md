# Choosing Precise Names

## Overview

A name is the highest-bandwidth documentation there is: it appears at
every use, costs nothing to read, and cannot be skipped. A precise name
creates an image in the reader's mind of what the thing is; a vague one
forces them to open the implementation.

Naming is also a design tool. A name that is hard to choose is telling
you the thing has no clear purpose, and that is a design problem
discovered cheaply.

## When to use

- Naming anything: a function, a type, a field, a parameter
- A review comment asks what something is
- A name needs a comment beside it to be understood
- Struggling to name something, which is the important case

Not for: deciding what to comment, which is
[writing-useful-comments](../writing-useful-comments/SKILL.md).

## Core rules

1. **Be precise, not general.** A name should distinguish this thing from
   everything nearby. `blockCount` beats `count`; `remainingBytes` beats
   `size`.
2. **Name the concept, not the shape.** `pendingInvoices` beats
   `invoiceList`. The reader can see it is a list.
3. **One word per concept, everywhere.** Pick `fetch` or `get` or `load`,
   and never use the other two for the same operation.
4. **Do not encode the type or the module.** `bookingService.bookingSave` is
   three redundancies; `Booking.save` says it once.
5. **Name what it returns, not what it does inside.** `total`, not
   `calculateAndCacheTotal`.
6. **Say what a boolean is true of.** `isExpired`, `hasUnpaidTreatments`.
   Never `flag`, `check`, `status` for a boolean.
7. **Treat difficulty as a signal.** If no good name exists, the thing is
   doing two jobs or has no clear identity. Fix that instead of settling.

## Pattern

Vague names, requiring the implementation to be read:

```text
process : Data -> Result
handle : Item -> Boolean
check (x, y)
```

Precise names, readable at the call site:

```text
priceBooking : ValidatedBooking -> Result<PricedBooking, PricingError>
isEligibleForRefund : BookedTreatment -> Boolean
assertWithinCreditLimit (used, limit)
```

The signature and the name together say enough that the body is never
opened out of confusion.

## The test

Show the name to someone who has not seen the code, and ask what it
holds or what it does. If they are wrong, or vague, the name is wrong.
Do not explain the name to them; their first reading is the measurement.

A second test that works alone: write the sentence you would use to
explain the thing. If the sentence contains a word that is not in the
name and cannot be inferred, the name is missing information.

## Common vague names and their repairs

| Vague          | Ask                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `data`, `info` | What information, specifically? |
| `manager`      | What does it decide?            |
| `handle`       | Handle it how, and to what end? |
| `process`      | Transform it into what?         |
| `helper`       | Whose job is it doing?          |
| `util`         | What concept do these share?    |
| `temp`         | What does it hold right now?    |
| `result`       | The result of what, as what?    |
| `value`        | The value of which quantity?    |
| `item`         | An item of what collection?     |
| `context`      | Which specific values, and why? |

## When a name will not come

This is valuable information. Work through it in this order:

1. **Two jobs.** Try to name each half. If both names come easily, split
   it. See
   [splitting-and-joining-code](../splitting-and-joining-code/SKILL.md).
2. **Wrong abstraction.** The thing is a bag of steps rather than a
   concept. Look for the concept the domain has a word for.
3. **Missing domain word.** Ask the experts what they call it. Often they
   have a word nobody wrote down. See
   [capturing-the-domain](../capturing-the-domain/SKILL.md).
4. **It should not exist.** A pass-through, an accidental split, a
   premature abstraction. Delete it and inline.

Never settle for `doStuff2`. Naming difficulty is the cheapest design
feedback available, and ignoring it is throwing it away.

## Red flags

- A name with a number in it
- A name that needs a comment on the same line to be understood
- Two names for the same concept in one codebase
- A name that describes the implementation, not the meaning
- A variable reused for two purposes under one name
- Any name that could apply to half the codebase
- Abbreviations that are not universal in the domain

## Common mistakes

- **Short names for wide scopes.** A one-letter name is fine in a
  three-line lambda and wrong for an exported function's parameter.
- **Long names as a substitute for design.**
  `validateAndNormaliseAndSaveBooking` names three jobs; split them.
- **Domain words used loosely.** If the business distinguishes "quote"
  from "estimate", the code must too.
- **Renaming without changing the concept.** A rename that does not make
  the thing clearer is churn.
- **Consistency with a bad convention forever.** Change it everywhere, or
  keep it; never half.
